# PM2.5 Concentration Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Description

This project is part of my personal portfolio and aims to predict PM2.5 particle concentration in the air using advanced machine learning techniques. PM2.5, or "Particulate Matter 2.5," refers to tiny airborne particles or droplets with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or smaller. These particles are a component of air pollution and have significant health and environmental impacts, making their prediction and management essential.

Time series analysis is applied to meteorological data and other environmental features to make these predictions.
